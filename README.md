This is a repo to host the (Markdown) source files of my personal website, including my Chinese and English blogs, as well as several project websites (such as [**knitr**](https://github.com/yihui/knitr).) The content of all pages is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

To build the website locally, you must clone this repo with its submodule (use the `--recursive` argument), e.g.,

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rbind/yihui.git
```

The website is built via the R package [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). Please read its documentation for how to use it.

I don't recommend you to study how my website is built, because it is complicated. In particular, the way I manage images is fairly complicated.
