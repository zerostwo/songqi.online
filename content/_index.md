I am a true "lone walker" who has never belonged wholeheartedly to my country, my hometown, my friends, or even my closest family. In the face of these relationships, I never lost the sense of alienation and the need for loneliness — a feeling that grew with each passing day. On the one hand, it can make people clearly realize that this will limit their mutual understanding and support with others, but I have no regrets. Such a man will undoubtedly lose some of his innocence and carelessness. On the other hand, such people are largely independent of the opinions, habits, and judgments of others, and avoid placing their inner balance on such shaky foundations.

我是一个真正的「独行者」，从未全心全意地属于过我的国家、我的家乡、我的朋友，乃至我最亲近的家人。面对这些关系，我从未消除那种疏离感，以及对孤独的需求——这种感觉随着岁月的流逝与日俱增。一方面，它能让人清楚地意识到，这将使自己与他人的相互理解和支持受到限制，但我毫无遗憾。这样的人无疑要失去一些天真无邪和无忧无虑。但另一方面，这样的人才能在很大程度上独立于他人的意见、习惯和判断，避免让自己内心的平衡置于这样一些不稳固的基础之上。
