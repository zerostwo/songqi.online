I was a true "loner" who never fully belonged to my country, my homeland, my friends, or even my closest family. In the face of these relationships, I have never been able to eliminate the feeling of alienation and the need for solitude - a feeling that grows with each passing day. On the one hand, it can make it clear that it will limit one's mutual understanding and support with others, but I have no regrets. Such a person would undoubtedly have to lose some of their innocence and carefreeness. On the other hand, such a person can be largely independent of the opinions, habits, and judgments of others and avoid placing his inner balance on such precarious foundations.

我是一个真正的「独行者」，从未全心全意地属于过我的国家、我的家乡、我的朋友，乃至我最亲近的家人。面对这些关系，我从未消除那种疏离感，以及对孤独的需求------这种感觉随着岁月的流逝与日俱增。一方面，它能让人清楚地意识到，这将使自己与他人的相互理解和支持受到限制，但我毫无遗憾。这样的人无疑要失去一些天真无邪和无忧无虑。但另一方面，这样的人才能在很大程度上独立于他人的意见、习惯和判断，避免让自己内心的平衡置于这样一些不稳固的基础之上。
