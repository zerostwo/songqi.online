# Definition

Violin plot allows to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. Each ‘violin’ represents a group or a variable. The shape represents the density estimate of the variable: the more data points in a specific range, the larger the violin is for that range. It is really close to a boxplot, but allows a deeper understanding of the distribution.
