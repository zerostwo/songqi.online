My name is Songqi Duan. You can know more about me on my [vitae](../vitae/). I love mathematics and computer science. I plan to become a researcher in the future, and I am still an undergraduate (entered in September 2017). After entering university, I discovered the direction of bioinformatics. When I saw her at first glance, I knew that I could not leave her in the future. As the saying goes, a bioinformatics learner who canâ€™t program is not a good food man, so I started my long self-study in bioinformatics.

I am calm, silent, flexible, adaptable, and strongly dissatisfied with the status quo. For anything of interest, I must explore a reasonable explanation. Like theory and abstract things, like conceptual thinking, but not social. In the area of interest, I have the extraordinary ability to focus and solve problems in depth. Have a skeptical spirit, sometimes like to criticize, often good at analysis.

# Personal interests

  There was a Schnauzer at home, strictly following the [Ten Commandments for Dogs](/cn/2020/08/ten-commandments-for-dogs/).

2. Animation

  The Naruto that has been chasing since childhood is over, and now I prefer to watch the new fan of each quarter, especially about love and daily life.
