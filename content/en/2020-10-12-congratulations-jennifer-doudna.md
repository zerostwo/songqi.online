I just finished watching ["First Day in a Nobel Life: Jennifer Doudna
"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3BlAOu17aU), I'm so excited, so touched!

Through the video, I saw his son, who seemed to be as old as me, and I saw pride in his glasses. Jennifer met her colleague later and touched her arms so cutely. I don't know why I cried.
