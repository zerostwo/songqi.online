      <description>Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts.
Think it over……
Today we have higher buildings and wider highways, but shorter temperaments and narrower points of view;
We spend more, but enjoy less;
We have bigger houses, but smaller families;
We have more compromises, but less time;
We have more knowledge, but less judgment;
We have more medicines ,but less health;
We have multiplied out possessions, but reduced out values;</description>
